 * @plugindesc v1.00 Allows you to change window title, and saves it properly
 * @author Jimmy Fallon
 *
 * 
 * @help
 * Normally, "document.title" can be used to change the window title mid gameplay.
 * This, however, comes with the problem that the changed title won't be saved, meaning
 * you have to set it back each time after a save is loaded.
 * 
 * This plugin fixes that by allowing you to change the title and have it save at the same time.
 * This is done by using plugin command "AngryAutisticHouseWives" followed by whatever title you want
 * to write. No quotations, parantheses, or anything else. Just type in the name.
 * Additionally, you can also change the title via script command AngryAutisticHouseWives("title here").
 * This requires quotations, however.
 * Both methods work, and will change the title, and also keep the title as such for the rest of that save.
 * You can reissue the command whenever to change the title to something else.
 * 
 * If I got within 10 miles range of Samuel Calder√≥n they could not pull me away with an industrial workforce magnet.
