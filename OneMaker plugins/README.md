### These Are Not Standard Plugins.

These files are for modifying ([OneMaker MV](https://mods.one/mod/onemakermv)), and as such require the most recent version to be installed.

### How To Install

To install, please read the comment at the top of each respective file to see what to rename the file to, where to place it in _hijack_root/qml/, and what the mod generally does.

QML files can be read by most text editors, so simply open it in vsCode or Notepad++ to view the comment.

OneMaker needs to be restarted for these changes to take effect.
